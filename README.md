# ChessAI
 
This is the game of Chess implemented in python.

The game is made with the help of this dude's tutorials, but with some changes in ui and other functions. <br>

I'll add multiple variants of bots, random, AI, maybe NN, mimax etc.

I'll also try and make a browser version in the future, so anyone can play with it.
